Enjoy Your Life

I, I know
You've been feeling stuck, feeling low
You can't see
How good this life can be

Looking to the future like it's gonna make you happy
Save you from reality, yeah, yeah
Imagining the worst like it's gonna end so badly, yeah, yeah

(Mmm) sit back and enjoy your problems
(Oh) you don't always have to solve them
